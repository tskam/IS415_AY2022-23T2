    "text": "The purpose of the geospatial analytics project is to provide students first hand experience on building web-based geospatial analytics tool by integrating open source web mapping API(s), data visualisation API(s) and geospatial analysis libraries. You will also learn how to collecting, processing and analysing spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the first week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor before the end of Week 8. A project proposal in the form website edited using Quarto and publish on Netlify will be prepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by the end of Week 8.\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project, problems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the details including the final application, user guide, poster, practice research paper by the end of week 14."

The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\n\n\nProject Website\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using Quatro. It will be disseminated by using Netfity web service.\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\n\nThe title of your project,\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at eLearn).\n\n\n\n\nPoster\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\n\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\n\nNote: The poster will be considered a final deliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design and data visualisation principles and best practice to your poster.\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Application Practice Research Paper\nThe research paper should be in the form of Geospatial Analytics Application practice and research. In particular it should contain the followings:\n\nMotivation of the application\nReview and critic on past works\nDesign framework - A detail description of the design principles used and data visualisation elements built (Refer to Section IV: Interface of this paper.\nDemonstration - Use case\nDiscussion - What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? A full blown user study is not expected, but informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.\nFuture Work - A description of how your system could be extended or refined.\n\nThe research paper should include an abstract of not more than 300 words. The actual research paper itself should not more than 6 pages excluding figures, tables, formula and references. The practice research paper must be edited by using ACM: Association for Computing Machinery template of Quarto Journal/Article template should be used.\n\nSample practice research papers\n\nDIVAD: A Dynamic and Interactive Visual Analytical Dashboard for Exploring and Analyzing Transport Data\nMEPHAS: an interactive graphical user interface for medical and pharmaceutical statistical analysis with R and Shiny\nSpatialEpiApp: A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Disease Data\nDeveloping web-based data analysis tools for precision farming using R and Shiny\nEHDViz: clinical dashboard development using open-source technologies\nHealth Equity Assessment Toolkit\nInteractive Pharmacometric Applications Using R and the Shiny Package\n\n\n\n\nFinal Deliverables\nThe final deliverable will include:\n\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\nproject poster\na practice research paper"

A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\nGrading criteria for poster\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\n\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\nClear communication of design approaches\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\nCraft quality of the solution"

Such properties are usually measured with the so-called quadrat analysis, nearest neighbour index and kernel estimation. Second-order properties describe the covariance (or correlation) between values of the spatial point pattern at different regions in space and are usually measured with the G function, K function and L function. Applied to point event data, both properties could be used to explore the spatial variation in the risk of being victimized by a crime, spatial and space-time clustering of criminal activities, and the raised incidence of criminal activities around point sources, such as robberies around ATM machines, subway entrances and exits, etc."

    "text": "Where should the next new business outlet be located in order to optimise the profit? What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\nGeospatial analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on\n\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and process using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\nConducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and machine learning methods and\nbuilding web-based geospatial analytics applications."

    "text": "Course Assessment Details\n\nClass Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\nAY2021-22 Sample Take-home Exercises\n\nTake-home Exercise 1\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report."

    "text": "Setting the Scene\nWater is an important resource to mankind. Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have access to sufficient clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater.\nDeveloping countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issues in many countries globally, especially countries in the Africa continent.\nTo address the issue of providing clean and sustainable water supply to the rural community, a global Water Point Data Exchange (WPdx) project has been initiated. The main aim of this initiative is to collect water point related data from rural areas at the water point or small water scheme level and share the data via WPdx Data Repository, a cloud-based data library. What is so special of this project is that data are collected based on WPDx Data Standard."

In general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate.\nThe COVID-19 vaccination in Indonesia is an ongoing mass immunisation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. On 13 January 2021, the program commenced when President Joko Widodo was vaccinated at the presidential palace. In terms of total doses given, Indonesia ranks third in Asia and fifth in the world.\nAccording to wikipedia, as of 5 February 2023 at 18:00 WIB (UTC+7), 204,266,655 people had received the first dose of the vaccine and 175,131,893 people had been fully vaccinated; 69,597,474 of them had been inoculated with the booster or the third dose, while 1,585,164 had received the fourth dose. Jakarta has the highest percentage of population fully vaccinated with 103.46%, followed by Bali and Special Region of Yogyakarta with 85.45% and 83.02% respectively.\nDespite its compactness, the cumulative vaccination rate are not evenly distributed within DKI Jakarta. The question is where are the sub-districts with relatively higher number of vaccination rate and how they changed over time."
