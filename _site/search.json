    "text": "The purpose of the geospatial analytics project is to provide students first hand experience on building web-based geospatial analytics tool by integrating open source web mapping API(s), data visualisation API(s) and geospatial analysis libraries. You will also learn how to collecting, processing and analysing spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the first week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor before the end of Week 8. A project proposal in the form website edited using Quarto and publish on Netlify will be prepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by the end of Week 8.\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project, problems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the details including the final application, user guide, poster, practice research paper by the end of week 14."

The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\n\n\nProject Website\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using Quatro. It will be disseminated by using Netfity web service.\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\n\nThe title of your project,\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at eLearn).\n\n\n\n\nPoster\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\n\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\n\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\n\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\nResolution = 300dpi or above\nFile format = jpeg\n\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\nThe poster will be considered as a final deliverable. So don’t forget to apply good visual design principles to both your poster and project report.\nNote: The course instructor will be responsible for printing your poster. You are required to upload your poster onto the project Dropbox of eLearn according to the submission deadline provided on the project milesotne sub-section.\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Application Practice Research Paper\nThe research paper should be in the form of Geospatial Analytics Application practice and research. In particular it should contain the followings:\n\nMotivation of the application\nReview and critic on past works\nDesign framework - A detail description of the design principles used and data visualisation elements built (Refer to Section IV: Interface of this paper.\nDemonstration - Use case\nDiscussion - What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? A full blown user study is not expected, but informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.\nFuture Work - A description of how your system could be extended or refined.\n\nThe research paper should include an abstract of not more than 300 words. The actual research paper itself should not more than 6 pages excluding figures, tables, formula and references. The practice research paper must be edited by using ACM: Association for Computing Machinery template of Quarto Journal/Article template should be used.\n\nSample practice research papers\n\nDIVAD: A Dynamic and Interactive Visual Analytical Dashboard for Exploring and Analyzing Transport Data\nMEPHAS: an interactive graphical user interface for medical and pharmaceutical statistical analysis with R and Shiny\nSpatialEpiApp: A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Disease Data\nDeveloping web-based data analysis tools for precision farming using R and Shiny\nEHDViz: clinical dashboard development using open-source technologies\nHealth Equity Assessment Toolkit\nInteractive Pharmacometric Applications Using R and the Shiny Package\n\n\n\n\nFinal Deliverables\nThe final deliverable will include:\n\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\nproject poster\na practice research paper"

A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\nGrading criteria for poster\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\n\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\nClear communication of design approaches\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\nCraft quality of the solution"

Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll acts of academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, facilitation of acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of exam questions, or tampering with the academic work of other students) are serious offences. All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of assessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of the policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. When in doubt, students should consult the instructors of the course. Details on the SMU Code of Academic Integrity may be accessed at http://www.smuscd.org/resources.html\n\n\n\nCourse materials obtained during your course of study at SMU are meant for personal use only, namely, for the purposes of studying and research.

Printed materials and electronic materials are both protected by copyright laws. All students are subject to Singapore copyright laws and must strictly adhere to SMU’s procedures and requirements relating to copyright.\nPlease also note that for some materials, the publishers may specifically state that each copy is for the personal use of one individual only and no further reprographic reproduction is allowed, including for personal use. These restrictions are spelt out clearly on these specific sets of resources and students are required to adhere to these rules.\nStudents who infringe any of the aforesaid rules, laws and requirements shall be liable to disciplinary action by SMU. In addition, such students may also leave themselves open to suits by copyright owners who are entitled to take legal action against persons who infringe their copyright.\nWe strongly urge all students to respect the copyright laws and abide by SMU’s procedures and requirements relating to copyright.\n\n\n\nSMU strives to make learning experiences accessible for all. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers due to disability, please let the instructor know immediately. You are also welcome to contact the university’s disability support team if you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations:included@smu.edu.sg\nPlease be aware that the accessible tables in our seminar room should remain available for students who require them. Emergency Preparedness for Teaching and Learning (EPTL): As part of emergency preparedness, Instructors may conduct lessons online via the WebEx platform during the term, to prepare students for online learning. During an actual emergency, students will be notified to access the WebEx platform for their online lessons. The class schedule will mirror the current face-to-face class timetable unless otherwise stated."

Such properties are usually measured with the so-called quadrat analysis, nearest neighbour index and kernel estimation. Second-order properties describe the covariance (or correlation) between values of the spatial point pattern at different regions in space and are usually measured with the G function, K function and L function. Applied to point event data, both properties could be used to explore the spatial variation in the risk of being victimized by a crime, spatial and space-time clustering of criminal activities, and the raised incidence of criminal activities around point sources, such as robberies around ATM machines, subway entrances and exits, etc."

    "text": "Where should the next new business outlet be located in order to optimise the profit? What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\nGeospatial analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on\n\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and process using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\nConducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and machine learning methods and\nbuilding web-based geospatial analytics applications."

Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\nAY2021-22 Sample Take-home Exercises\n\nTake-home Exercise 1\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report."

    "text": "Setting the Scene\nWater is an important resource to mankind. Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have access to sufficient clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater.\nDeveloping countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issues in many countries globally, especially countries in the Africa continent.\nTo address the issue of providing clean and sustainable water supply to the rural community, a global Water Point Data Exchange (WPdx) project has been initiated. The main aim of this initiative is to collect water point related data from rural areas at the water point or small water scheme level and share the data via WPdx Data Repository, a cloud-based data library. What is so special of this project is that data are collected based on WPDx Data Standard."

In general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate.\nThe COVID-19 vaccination in Indonesia is an ongoing mass immunisation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. On 13 January 2021, the program commenced when President Joko Widodo was vaccinated at the presidential palace. In terms of total doses given, Indonesia ranks third in Asia and fifth in the world.\nAccording to wikipedia, as of 5 February 2023 at 18:00 WIB (UTC+7), 204,266,655 people had received the first dose of the vaccine and 175,131,893 people had been fully vaccinated; 69,597,474 of them had been inoculated with the booster or the third dose, while 1,585,164 had received the fourth dose. Jakarta has the highest percentage of population fully vaccinated with 103.46%, followed by Bali and Special Region of Yogyakarta with 85.45% and 83.02% respectively.\nDespite its compactness, the cumulative vaccination rate are not evenly distributed within DKI Jakarta.

    "text": "Setting the Scene\nHousing is an essential component of household wealth worldwide. Buying a housing has always been a major investment for most people. The price of housing is affected by many factors. Some of them are global in nature such as the general economy of a country or inflation rate. Others can be more specific to the properties themselves. These factors can be further divided to structural and locational factors. Structural factors are variables related to the property themselves such as the size, fitting, and tenure of the property. Locational factors are variables related to the neighbourhood of the properties such as proximity to childcare centre, public transport service and shopping centre.\nConventional, housing resale prices predictive models were built by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. However, this method failed to take into consideration that spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity exist in geographic data sets such as housing transactions. With the existence of spatial autocorrelation, the OLS estimation of predictive housing resale pricing models could lead to biased, inconsistent, or inefficient results (Anselin 1998). In view of this limitation, Geographical Weighted Models were introduced for calibrating predictive model for housing resale prices."

    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need. (Warning: All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\nGeospatial Analysis and Modelling (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use appropriate statistical analysis and GWR functions introduced in class to calibrate hedonic price models. The focus of this criterion should go beyond discussing the modelling results, but include Exploratory Data Analysis, multivariate analysis analysis for detecting multicollinearity, and spatial autocorrelation test, just to name a few of them.\nGeovisualisation (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the complex spatial statistics results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (20 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of RMarkdown. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (10 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data. The methods used must be geospatial in nature."

The earlier is popularly known as Classification Trees and the later is known as Regression Trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of Recursive Partitioning\n\n\n\nWorking with continuous predictor(s)\n\nIf a predictor is continuous, then the partition is done according to a splitting “cut” value for X. For example, Average Days Delinquent < 12.3 or >=12.3 as shown in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with categorical predictor(s)\n\nIf the predictor is categorical, then it divides the X categories into two groups of levels and considers all possible groupings into two levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of Classification and Regression Tree (CART)\n\n\nA CART is read from the top down starting at the root node.\n\nEach internal node represents a split based on the values of one of the inputs. The inputs can appear in any number of splits throughout the tree. Cases move down the branch that contains its input value.\nThe terminal nodes of the tree are called leaves. The leaves represent the predicted target. All cases reaching a particular leaf are given the same predicted value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful features and advantages of Recursive Partitioning\n\nRecursive partitioning is nonparametric and therefore does not rely on data belonging to a particular type of distribution.\nRecursive partitioning is not significantly impacted by outliers in the input variables.\nYou can relax stopping rules to “overgrow” decision trees and then prune back the tree to the optimal size. This approach minimizes the probability that important structure in the data set will be overlooked by stopping too soon.\nRecursive partitioning incorporates both testing with a test data set and cross-validation to assess the goodness of fit more accurately.\nRecursive partitioning can use the same variables more than once in different parts of the tree. This capability can uncover complex interdependencies between sets of variables.\nRecursive partitioning can be used in conjunction with other prediction methods to select the input set of variables."

    "text": "What Spatial Interaction Models are?\n\n\nSpatial interaction or “gravity models” estimate the flow of people, material, or information between locations in geographical space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpatial interaction models seek to explain existing spatial flows. As such it is possible to measure flows and predict the consequences of changes in the conditions generating them. When such attributes are known, it is possible to better allocate transport resources such as conveyances, infrastructure, and terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditions for Spatial Flows\n\nThree interdependent conditions are necessary for a spatial interaction to occur:\n\n\n\n\nComplementarity. There must be a supply and a demand between the interacting locations. A residential zone is complementary to an employment zone because the first is supplying workers while the second is supplying jobs. The same can be said concerning the complementarity between a store and its customers and between an industry and its suppliers (movements of freight). An economic system is based on a large array of complementary activities.\nIntervening opportunity (lack of). Refers to a location that may offer a better alternative as a point of origin or as a point of destination. For instance, in order to have an interaction of a customer to a store, there must not be a closer store that offers a similar array of goods. Otherwise, the customer will likely patronize the closer store and the initial interaction will not take place.\nTransferability. Mobility must be supported by transport infrastructures, implying that the origin and the destination must be linked. Costs to overcome distance must not be higher than the benefits of the related interaction, even if there are complementarity and no alternative opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of a Movement as a Spatial Interaction\n\n\nRepresenting mobility as a spatial interaction involves several considerations:\n\nLocations: A movement is occurring between a location of origin and a location of destination. i generally denotes an origin while j is a destination.\nCentroid: An abstraction of the attributes of a zone at a point.\nFlows: Flows are generally expressed by a valued vector Tij representing an interaction between locations i and j.\nVectors: A vector Tij links two centroids and has a value assigned to it (50) which can represents movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations. A movement is occurring between a location of origin and a location of destination. i generally denotes an origin while j is a destination. The representation of origins and destinations commonly involves centroids.\nCentroid. An abstraction of the attributes of a zone at a point. This is of particular relevance when the attributes generating mobility are zonal (e.g. ZIP codes, cities, states, etc.) while the graphic representation requires specific origins and destinations. For instance, showing flows between ZIP codes would implicitly require the generation of one centroid for each ZIP code.\nFlows. Flows are generally expressed by a valued vector Tij representing an interaction between locations i and j.\nVectors. On the above figure, two areas, zone i and zone j, are represented as two centroids, i and j. A vector Tij links two centroids and has a value assigned to it (50) which can represents movements such as tons of freight, numbers of passengers per day, or number of phone calls."

    "text": "What Spatial Interaction Models are?\n\n\nSpatial interaction or “gravity models” estimate the flow of people, material, or information between locations in geographical space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSpatial interaction models seek to explain existing spatial flows. As such it is possible to measure flows and predict the consequences of changes in the conditions generating them. When such attributes are known, it is possible to better allocate transport resources such as conveyances, infrastructure, and terminals."

From this graph, an O/D matrix can be built where each O/D pair becomes a cell. A value of 0 is assigned for each O/D pair that does not have an observed flow."

Vi are the attributes of the location of origin i, Wj are the attributes of the location of destination j, and Sij are the attributes of separation between the location of origin i and the location of destination j.\nFrom this general formulation, three basic types of interaction models can be derived:"
