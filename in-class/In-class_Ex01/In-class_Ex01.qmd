## What is Reproducible Research?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Research is considered to be reproducible when the exact results can be reproduced if given access to the original data, software, or code.

-   Reproducible research is sometimes known as reproducibility, reproducible statistical analysis, reproducible data analysis, reproducible reporting, and literate programming.

## Why Research need to be Reproducible?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   According to a [Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970), more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.

### What needs to be reproduced?

The "what" that needs to be reproduced is typically:

-   Actual results themselves, which includes:
    -   Tables

    -   Visualizations/figures/graphs

    -   Values reported in the text
-   The statistical evidence in support of the findings (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals, credible intervals).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Ten simple rules for reproducible research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285#s9)

-   For every result, keep track of how it was produced.
-   Avoid manual data manipulation steps.
-   Archive the excat versions of all external programmes used.
-   Version control all custom scripts.
-   Record all intermedia results, when possible in standard formats.
-   For analysis that include randomness, note underlying random seeds.
-   Always store raw data behind plots.
-   Generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected.
-   Connect textual statements to underlying results.
-   Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results.

## R: A very brief introduction

-   R is a powerful **language** and **environment** for **statistical computing and graphics**. It is a re-implementation of the S language, which was developed in the 1980's.

-   R is a high level language. The core language has some superficial similarities to C, but many things are handled automatically in R that are not in C.

-   It is a [**free and open source software (FOSS)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) General Public License in source code form.

-   It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

-   It is available from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The R environment

-   An effective data handling and storage facility,

-   A suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,

-   A large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

-   It is highly *extensible* and it has thousands of well-documented extensions (named R packages) for a very broad range of applications areas such as finance, business, economic, biostatistics and etc (As of August 2022 \~18471 R packages).

-   It has a vast community both in academia and in business such as [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installing and Configurating R

-   Download R installer by visiting one of the following links:

    -   [Windows user](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

    -   [MacOS user](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

-   Install R by clicking on the installer. If necessary, provide the installer administrator right. Install R in the root directory when prompted.

-   After the installation completed, check the environment variable of your computer. If R path is not defined, you should update the path manually.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introducing Rtools

-   A toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source (those that need compilation of C/C++ or Fortran code) and for build R itself.

-   Download RTools from this [site](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

-   After the installation complete, check the environment variable of your computer to ensure that RTools path is there.

## Introducing [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/)

-   A free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

## Introducing Quarto![](img/image4a.jpg){fig-align="center" width="180"}

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system designed and developed by [posit](https://posit.co/) formally known as RStudio.

![](img/image4.jpg){width="1067"}

## Introducing Quarto

-   Quarto documents are authored using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy to write plain text format.

-   Quarto documents are generated using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a universal document converter.

![](img/image4b.jpg)

## Introducing Quarto

-   A method of [*literate programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) that embed code and output from Python, R, and JavaScript via integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/), and [Observable](https://github.com/observablehq/).

    ![](img/image5.jpg){width="1000"}

## Introducing Quarto

-   A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.

-   A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and [books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

-   Authoring using a wide variety of editors and notebooks including [JupyterLab](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html), [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html), and [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html).

-   A [visual markdown editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) that provides a productive writing interface for composing long-form documents.
