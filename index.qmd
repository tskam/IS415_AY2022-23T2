## Words of Encouragement

For the next 12 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming

![](img/image4.png)

Learning R can be difficult at first---it's like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham---the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like ggplot2 --- made this wise observation:

> It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, "Oh it's me, I'm really stupid," or, "I'm not made out to program." But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.

If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don't hesitate to approach me.

The students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don't work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.

If you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.

Our goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There's no such thing as a perfect programmer. I've been learning new things almost every day.

I promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don't give up easily.
