## R packages for Data Science

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): a family of modern R packages specially designed to meet the tasks of Data Science and Analytics.
-   [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/): a fast and effective library to parse csv, txt, and tsv files as [tibble data.frame](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) in R. To get started, refer to Chapter 11 Data import of R for Data Science book.\
-   [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/): an R package for tidying data. To get started, refer to [Chapter 12 Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) of R for Data Science book.\
-   [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): a grammar of data manipulation. To get started, read articles under [Getting Started](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html) and Articles tabs.
-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): a grammar of graphics. To get started, read [Chapter 3: Data Visualization](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [Chapter 28 Graphics for communication](Chapter%2028%20Graphics%20for%20communication) of R for Data Science book.
